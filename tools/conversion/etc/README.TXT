For licensing information, see the LICENSE.TXT file.
For documentation, see the HTML files in the docs directory.

jDip Conversion Tools allow the conversion of flat-text file
variant formats to jDip formats. 

What does this include?

Judge ".map" files
Realpolitik Variants

Note that a Judge map file is sufficient to create a jDip adjacency file, but
cannot completely specify the jDip "variants.xml" file.

Some editing of the output may be needed, as these tools cannot do the tweaking
nescessary to create an optimal jDip variant.

Please see the documentation for more information.
